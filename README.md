# 2020-2021 First Tech Challenge - Ultimate Goal Bot

This repository contains some code used in a competition bot for the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) 2020-2021 game, [Ultimate Goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2pgPQgHQ28). For the sake of my own personal privacy, I have left my team name and number undisclosed. If you were on my team and are reading this, you're a real one.  ðŸ™‚

## Update - 26th February, 2021

This branch contains the current codebase as of the end of the 2nd trimester (26th February, 2021).

As of right now, there is a functioning autonomous to only move to the launch line, as well as a partial TeleOp. The other stuff contained is either experimentation that was never fleshed out due to time constraints, or just basic testing code.
