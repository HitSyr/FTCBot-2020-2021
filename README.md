# 2020-2021 First Tech Challenge - Ultimate Goal Bot

This repository contains some code used in a competition bot for the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) 2020-2021 game, [Ultimate Goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2pgPQgHQ28). For the sake of my own personal privacy, I have left my team name and number undisclosed. If you were on my team and are reading this, you're a real one.  ðŸ™‚

## Update - 26th February, 2021

This branch contains the current codebase as of the end of the 2nd trimester (26th February, 2021).

As of right now, there is a functioning autonomous to only move to the launch line, as well as a partial TeleOp. The other stuff contained is either experimentation that was never fleshed out due to time constraints, or just basic testing code.

## Update #2 - 18th May, 2021

This repository is dead as of 10th March, 2021 (I'm quite late to this one, lol). The World Championship tournament has now been (sadly) officially cancelled. This source code is set to be archived in its current state and released at some point after June 2021 when the season officially ends. (If you're seeing this, then it's probably already out) Until then, I'll have to modify the git history and remove this team's Vuforia token before officially releasing this. I hope this code proves useful to any other future FTC teams. To all future teams reading this, I hope you all have a good season!
